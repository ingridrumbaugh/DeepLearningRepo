Started Bundle covers:
-- Machine Learning 
-- Neural Networks 
-- CNNs 

The next bundle is Practitioner which covers deep learning more in-depth. 

Primary deep learning library: Keras. 
(Maintained by a deep learning researcher at Google) 
Can use Theano or TensorFlow for backend 

Other deep learning lib used in 3rd bundle: mxnet 
Specializes in distributed, multi-machine learning 
Parallelize training across GPUs when training deep neural network 
architectures on massive datasets (like ImageNet) 

Other Libs: OpenCV, scikit-image, scikit-learn 

TensorFlow & Theano are libs for defining abstract, general purpose computation graphs. Used for deep learning, but not deep learning frameworks. 
Keras is a deep learning framework providing an API to facilitate building deep
neural networks. 

Popular CNNs: AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet, SqueezeNet
